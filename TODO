* Port Board and Diamond classes to QGraphicsView and QGraphicsItem.
* Remove greeter, replace with "game over" widget. (KGamePopupItem might be of help here)
* When pausing game, show some message like "Game is paused. Press "resume" to continue plaing"
  (Again can use KGamePopupItem for displaying it)
