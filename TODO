Feel free to add your own suggestions for KDiamond below.
* When the time is up, let the board finish all moves before the game is finished.
* Optimize pixmap generation. (Just to throw in a buzzword: Is multithreading possible?)
* Write a handbook.
If you want to do one of these jobs, please send a mail to majewsky@gmx.net to avoid duplicate effort. Thanks.
