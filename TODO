Feel free to add your own suggestions for KDiamond below.
* Debug the KGameThemeSelector. (That is the next item on my personal todo list. -- Stefan)
* Move pixmap generation for animations to a separate thread. (It might be necessary to turn the renderer into a singleton.)
* Add KNotify support.
* Write a handbook.
If you want to do one of these jobs, please send a mail to majewsky@gmx.net to avoid duplicate effort. Thanks.
